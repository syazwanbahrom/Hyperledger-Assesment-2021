## Hyperledger Fabric Developer Certification Training - Assessment

## What is the purpose of this assessment?
You have been selected for assessment for Hyperledger Fabric developer certification training sponsored by Yayasan Peneraju Pendidikan Bumiputera. 
This assessment is designed to evaluate your programming fundamentals, critical thinking, and software engineering practices.

Use any programming language you like to complete this assessment, but we recommend Python, NodeJS, Typescript, or Java.

## Section 1
Please complete the following and send the assessment to the email address provided.

### Question 1

Using NO BUILT IN LIBRARIES, write a program that satisfies the following problem:  

`n!` means `n × (n − 1) × ... × 3 × 2 × 1`

For example, `10! = 10 × 9 × ... × 3 × 2 × 1 = 3628800`,
and the sum of the digits in the number `10!` is `3 + 6 + 2 + 8 + 8 + 0 + 0 = 27`.

Find the sum of the digits in the number 100!

## Section 2
This section will evaluate your software practices, with a focus on object oriented programming. Do this question in a sepereate folder, in your preferred programming language.

### Question 1
We have provided you with a stub class called `Account` that represents a bank account. Please fill out the stub functions, then write a program that creates 3 unique instances of the class, and store them in a data structure of your choice. Explain your thought process behind choosing a data structure.

```
class Account:
    def __init__(self, name, balance):
        self.id
        self.name
        self.balance

    def deposit(self, amount):

    def withdraw(self, amount):

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.name}'s account. Balance: {self.balance}"
```

### Question 2
We have recieved a request to create a new class `DevAccount` inheriting from the `Account` class for testing and development purposes. This new class contains the additional functions:
<ul>
<li> Get Balance </li>
<li> Set Balance </li>
<li> Transfer to other account</li>

</ul>
Please implement the afformentioned class and their functions
